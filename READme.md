# Amazon ML Challenge - Machine Learning Model for Data Classification and Analysis

## Overview

This repository provides a solution to the Amazon ML Challenge, which involves building a machine learning model for analyzing and classifying data. The notebook included applies modern machine learning techniques to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and visualize results.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains features that represent [add a description of the data based on the notebook]. This includes:

Numerical Features: [List numerical features].

Categorical Features: [List categorical features].

Target Variable: [Description of the target variable].

## Observations from the Dataset:

Missing values exist in [specific columns].

Data contains outliers in [specific columns].

Categorical data needs encoding for machine learning models.

## Project Workflow

**Step 1:** Problem Understanding

Objective: Develop a model that predicts [specific task] with high accuracy.

Approach: Use supervised learning techniques for [classification/regression] tasks.

**Step 2:** Data Preprocessing

## Missing Data Handling:

Numerical features: Imputed using [median/mean].

Categorical features: Imputed with [most frequent category].

**Encoding:**

Used [One-Hot Encoding/Label Encoding] for categorical variables.

**Scaling:**

Standardized numerical features using [standard scaling].

## Data Splitting:

Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets in an 80-10-10 ratio.

**Step 3:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions and relationships using matplotlib and seaborn.

Identified key trends and feature importance.

**Step 4:** Model Building

Used a [specific model, e.g., Random Forest] for prediction.

Hyperparameter tuning using [Grid Search/Randomized Search].

****Step 5**:** Model Evaluation

## Metrics Used:

Accuracy for classification.

**F1-Score** for imbalanced datasets.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression.

**Step 6:** Results Visualization

Plotted feature importance and residuals.

**Step 7:** Deployment (Optional)

Provided an approach for deploying the model using [Flask/FastAPI].
